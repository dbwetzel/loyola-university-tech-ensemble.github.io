  We develop software that enables and complements our performances. Our software
  is free and open source so you can use it in your own performances and make
  your own contributions.

    <h2>'In C' Performance App</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Are you joining us in an upcoming performance? This is the software you need!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This software drives our performances of Terry Riley's 1964 classic minimalist
      piece 'In C'. With this app performers can participate regardless of musical
      experience, enabling them to listen and react to those around them in the same
      way that classically trained musicians do. Performers sync their clocks
      together by sound and then are completely free running with no need for an
      internet connection. In addition to the internal sound synthesis engine,
      performers can control other software or external hardware using MIDI. Source
      code is available <a href="https://github.com/loyola-university-tech-ensemble/InC">on Github</a>.

    <h2>'In C' Progress Viewer</h2>
    <p>
      This software pairs with the 'In C' performance app, which watches for the
      phrases each performer is currently playing. The app presents this information
      in a projector-friendly display, which will automatically scroll to the
      earliest phrase that is currently being played so it's set-and-forget. This has
      proven to be useful for new performers to understand where their peers and how
      quickly they should be moving between phrases. It's also helpful for the
      audience to understand what is happening better than a typical 'In C'
      performance. Source code is available <a href="https://github.com/loyola-university-tech-ensemble/in-c-score-progress">on Github</a>.
