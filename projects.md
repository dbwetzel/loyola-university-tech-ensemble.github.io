## 'In C' Performance App

This software drives our performances of Terry Riley's 1964 classic minimalist
piece 'In C'. With this app performers can participate regardless of musical
experience, enabling them to listen and react to those around them in the same
way that classically trained musicians do. Performers sync their clocks
together by sound and then are completely free running with no need for an
internet connection. In addition to the internal sound synthesis engine,
performers can control other software or external hardware using MIDI.
Currently available for Windows and macOS.

## 'In C' Progress Viewer

This software pairs with the 'In C' performance app, which watches for the
phrases each performer is currently playing. The app presents this information
in a projector-friendly display, which will automatically scroll to the
earliest phrase that is currently being played so it's set-and-forget. This has
proven to be useful for new performers to understand where their peers and how
quickly they should be moving between phrases. It's also helpful for the
audience to understand what is happening better than a typical 'In C'
performance. This app is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
