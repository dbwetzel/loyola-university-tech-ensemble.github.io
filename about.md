Loyola University Technology Ensemble formed during the first offering of the
*Introduction to Digital Music* course ([COMP122][] & MUSC122). We could
be considered a "laptop orchestra" in the same vein as those at [Stanford][slork] and [Princeton][plork], but we chose a broader title to include
our music technology research and classic ensemble instrumentation.
