The Launchpad S is a MIDI controller designed to be used with Ableton Live, but
is flexible enough for most applications. For our performance of *In C*, I
wanted to build an instrument that could trigger all 53 phrases of the piece
and use the remaining buttons as a simple drum sequencer. The Launchpad's
multi-color LEDs provided enough visual feedback that I only needed to look at
my laptop screen to manually adjust the position of the Score Viewer
application.

Finish this...
