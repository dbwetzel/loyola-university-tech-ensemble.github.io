LUTE have an upcoming informal reading of Terry Riley's "In C" arranged for
laptop ensemble on December 13th, 2017. Come take a stress break from final
exams to commune with Terry Riley's 1964 minimalist masterwork via laptop. We
are seeking thoughtful individuals from all backgrounds and technical and/or
musical abilities. This all-laptop version of "In C" is designed to be
inclusive for musicians, "non" musicians, and anyone who wants to experience
playing in an ensemble in a whole new way. The emphasis is on listening,
responding, and collaborating to make music. Let the machines handle playing
all the notes for once!

If you are planning attending, please bring a laptop running either macOS or
Windows. We are looking for audience participation! If you can, please come
when the doors open at 9am so we can help you set up your computer. This reading
is informal, so come and go as you please!
