For our Fall 2016 performance of Terry Riley's *In C*, we wrote a small
application to display to our audience which phrases our performers were
currently playing. Due to time constraints, the operator of the computer
running the projection would have to manually scroll the list of phrases
depending on what the lowest phrase number is. Now with the release of version
1.1, the app will smoothly scroll to the lowest phrase number, making it
totally hands-free!

Additionally, when performers trigger phrase playback it will cause the
indicator in the app to flash. This is will demonstrate to the audience how
active the performers are, so if a particular performer has stopped playing
their indicator will be dim.

This new release is available from our GitHub project page. If there are
additional features you would like to add, submit an issue or contribute
a pull request!
